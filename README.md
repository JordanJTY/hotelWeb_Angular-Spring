## About this project

### Why I did it?

When I was thinking about what application to do, I remembered that I had never asked for an apartment reservation in my whole life. Also, I live on a tourist island, so I decided to research these services to find out how they work when people order an apartment.

## Installation guide

##### Requirements

- Eclipse IDE o IntelliJ IDEA.
- MySQL Workbench.
- PostMan, for RESTFul tests.
- Visual Studio Code.

##### Get started 

###### Frontend

[angular-icon]

To get started, create an empty folder on your computer and open your Visual Studio Code.

Once open, go to Files > Open Folder > and select the folder you just created.

Now, open a terminal in the new folder.

![newTerminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/206923001-02dca638-9c1d-4b65-a5ca-f622c899171b.png)

Once you are in the terminal of your folder execute the following commands:

* clone repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/JordanJTY/hotelWeb_Angular-Spring
    ```

Install all project's dependencies (Patience! It may take a few minutes):
 
* npm
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

When dependencies have been installed, you can go to set up your backend.

###### Backend

[spring-icon]

To get started, open the backend of the project with the IDE of your choice. In my case, I used IntelliJ.

![openedIDE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/206922111-cc3cae87-53f0-4a4e-b1e3-d304c016cf65.png)

Once you have the backend open, go to MYSQL Workbench and check your username and password to access in your IDE. Also, take advantage of this opportunity to create a database where you save your data with the name you prefer:

![createDB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/206922786-2debae45-be7d-4dbe-a88f-981c699fc96c.png)

Once these steps are done, you can start your backend.

![changeBackendConfiguration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/206922838-c909d359-0a04-4dac-994b-0e5004dd1bc9.png)

Remember start your frontend!

* npm
    ```sh
    cd frontend/

    ng serve -o
    ```

## Data model

 - Entities and attributes.
 - Relations between tables.
 - Graph of the data model.

###### Entities and attributes

![ERDiagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/205692474-f9b3c0d6-8830-48aa-9bd3-6412835facd4.png)

Here we can see the entity-relationship model from which we can deduct its keys, entities and relationships.

As we can see, we have a database with 5 entities that we will later transform into tables. These are:

+ Doctor: atributes:

  - ID: Identification number of each doctor (cannot be null).
  - Name: Name of the doctor.
  - Surname: First surname.
  - Second last name: Second last name.
  - Collegiate_Num: Collegiate number of each doctor.
  - User_ID: Foreign user key in the medical table. It relates the user to the doctor.
  - DNI: National identity document.
    
    - FK: USER_ID
  
+ Patient: patient attributes:

  - ID: Identification number of each patient (cannot be null).
  - Name: Name of the patient.
  - Surname: First surname of the patient.
  - Second_surname: Second surname of the patient.
  - Image: an image of the patient will be saved.
  - DNI: National identity document.
  - History: Medical history of each patient.
  
  - FK: DOCTOR_ID
  
+ Prescriptions: prescription information:
 
  - Posology: Medication dosage.
  - Date: Date of the recipe.
  - Patient_name: Name of the patient to whom the prescription is issued.
  - Doctor_name: Name of the doctor issuing the prescription.
  - ID: Recipe identifier number (Cannot be null).
  - Medicine: Name of the medicine that is issued.
  - Doctor_id: Identifier of the doctor who issued the prescription.
  - Patien_id: Identifier of the patient for whom the prescription is made.
  
  - FK:PATIENT_ID
  - FK:DOCTOR_ID
  
+ User: in this entity the user data will be stored:

  - ID: User identifier (Cannot be null).
  - Email: Email of the user.
  - Password: user password.
  - Username: Username.
  
+ Role: Roles in the application:
 
  - ID: role identifier number (cannot be null).
  - Name: Name of the role.
  
  The information in this table will not change.

+ User_Role:intermediate table that is generated by the N:N relationship between user and role.
  -FK:USER_ID
  -FK:ROLE_ID

###### Relationships between tables

  - USER-ROLE: Many-to-many relationship, many users can have many roles.
  - USER-DOCTOR: One to one relationship, the doctor is a user.
  - DOCTOR-PATIENT: One to many relationship, in my data model a patient is associated with a single doctor, since it is a private practice and the doctor is only interested in seeing the information of his patients.
  - DOCTOR- PRESCRIPTIONS: One to many relationship, a doctor can make many prescriptions.
  - PATIENTS- PRESCRIPTIONS: One to many relationship, a patient can have many prescriptions at the same time.

## User requirements

###### Platform:
- **P1**.This app comes as a web app as it is understood to be made to be used in the workplace.
- **P2**.In any case, it can also be used on mobile or tablet devices since it is responsive.

###### Access:
- **A1**. The app has a guest screen that can be accessed without being logged in.
- **A2**. In order to use the page you must be registered as a doctor, an administrator will be in charge of registering the doctors previously.
- **A3**. To add, delete or modify the information of the doctors you must be an administrator.

###### Interfaces:

- **I1**.The app has 2 main interfaces that show lists of both patients and prescriptions.
- **I2**. The user registration and doctor registration interfaces will be available only for administrators.
- **I3**. In the main interfaces it will be possible to search patients by name.

###### Actions:

- **A1**.User actions will be accompanied by feedback andnotifications.
- **A2**. When entering data in the form, it is validated that the information is entered correctly, notifying the user if there is an error.

###### Validations:
---
## Use cases.

Below we can see the use case diagram, this is reduced to the actions that the doctor (main user of the application) and the administrator (in charge of adding or removing doctors from the system) can perform.

![UseCaseDiagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/207313239-b5bb35f6-f40c-454c-b18f-7b6042d1e24b.jpg)

As we can see in the image, when consulting a prescription, the doctor can modify, update or delete it, the same can be done with his patients.

In the case of the administrator, its only function is to consult the doctors that are in the system, delete them, modify them or introduce new ones.

## Usability and accessibility

###### Usability:
 
Regarding usability elements, we have a clear and simple clean design, adapted to all users. We recognize a color palette that is familiar to us from the medical field, but at the same time modern, including warmer colors.
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/206919510-3532a341-430c-4ce6-9c65-82e21cab3b7b.png)

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/206919497-a95362e0-3cf4-4acf-a469-a624acac2428.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95490721/206919999-6e7ff21b-3312-4766-83c4-27e6abe0409d.png)
 
 - Easy to understand, the user does not need more than three clicks to reach his goal with minimal effort. In addition, essential information is visible and clear.
 
 - Elegant in its design, it favors the user's perception, the soft colors of its interface and the homogeneity make the end user feel attracted to the product.
 
 - The user is able to interact with the application thanks to its elegant and simple design, overloading is avoided, which makes it difficult for users to easily navigate through applications.
 
 - Feedback and appropriate responses to user actions through messages and alerts
 
 - Clean layout of windows to create a seamless visual flow of information for the user.
 
 - Consistent interface, basic operations are intuitive and all done in the same way.
 
 - Clear and harmonious interface structure, menus and windows are consistent with each other.
 
 - Easy navigation through the page, both with mouse and keyboard.
 
 
######  Accessibility 
  
 - Accessibility is the attribute that allows people to easily perceive, understand and navigate the web. For this, the following has been taken into account:
 
 - Contrast between the background and the color of the font to favor reading and favor visual health, also pure white is not used to avoid glare and visual fatigue.
 
 - Well-defined form fields and fonts that favor the perfect legibility of the texts.
 
 - Design adaptable to all kinds of devices.
